<br> Question to myself: What is the purpose of this project? How do I seperate myself from other candidates.  
1. To show that I can create a web page that fetches data using Giphy API. 
2. To show that I am best suited for the position.
  <br>1. How do i show this? 
        <br> a) Since the existing system uses Ember, the most important aspect would be to be able to code in Ember.
        <br> b) Another important trait would be to be able to make animations in Ember as stated in the guidelines.
