**Breaking the project into steps.**
1. Evaluation
2. Preparing/Learning
3. Planning/Designing
4. Coding 

**1. Evaluation**
<br> Question to myself: What is the purpose of this project? How do I seperate myself from other candidates.  
1. To show that I can create a web page that fetches data using Giphy API. 
2. To show that I am best suited for the position.
  <br>1. How do I show this? 
        <br> a) Since the existing system uses Ember, the most important aspect would be to be able to code in Ember.
        <br> b) Another important trait would be to be able to make animations in Ember as stated in the guidelines. 
3. Upon reading the web SDK for Giphy and the implementation via Code-pen, coding the page shouldnt take more than 4 hours.  

Conclusion: Need to spend some time learning Ember.

**2. Preparing/Learning**
<br>Learning Ember, key notes and comments will be left below for my future reference. 
<br>While learning Ember, also consider the best practices for scaleable products. Which is to break components to their most elementary elements as much as possible.
